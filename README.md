## Tips for Best Results

1. **Business Owner Searches**: Focus on finding specific companies with owner contacts
   - Good: "roofing companies in Austin Texas owner contact information"
   - Better: "list of roofing contractors Austin Texas with owner names and emails"
   - Best: "top 10 roofing businesses Austin Texas decision maker contacts"

2. **Multiple Service Types**: Use commas to search multiple industries at once
   - Input: "roofing, plumbing, HVAC" ‚Üí Creates separate searches for each
   - Input: "restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries" ‚Üí Finds owners for each type
   - Input: "lawyer, accountant, consultant" ‚Üí Gets contacts for each profession

3. **Contractor Searches**: Be specific about trade and location
   - "licensed electrician contractors Nashville owner contacts"
   - "commercial HVAC companies Dallas business owner emails"
   - "residential plumbing services Phoenix decision maker list"

4. **Local Business Searches**: Include owner/decision-maker keywords
   - "restaurant owners downtown Chicago contact list"
   - "retail store managers Main Street district emails"
   - "auto repair shop owners Denver area directory"

5. **Government Searches**: Be specific about jurisdiction
   - "Texas state government cabinet members"
   - "New York City department commissioners"
   - "EPA regional directors contact list"

6. **Industry Association Searches**: Target member directories
   - "roofing contractors association California member list"
   - "restaurant owners association Austin member contacts"
   - "small business alliance Seattle directory"

7. **Rate Limits**: The tool respects API rate limits automatically

8. **Verification**: Email/phone verification improves data quality but takes longer

9. **Sources**: Always check the sources to verify information accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### No results found
- Try more specific queries
- Include company name and title
- Check if Perplexity can access the information

### Verification failing
- Check API keys are valid
- Ensure you have credits/quota remaining
- Some emails/phones may be unverifiable

### Script interrupted
- Use `--resume` to continue from where you left off
- Progress is automatically saved after each query
