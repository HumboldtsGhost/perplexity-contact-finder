- `NUMVERIFY_API_KEY`
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Search for a single contact:
```bash
python perplexity_contact_finder.py "John Smith CEO at Microsoft"
```

Search for multiple contacts:
```bash
python perplexity_contact_finder.py "Jane Doe CTO Google" "Bob Wilson CFO Apple" "Alice Brown CMO Meta"
```

### Using a File
Create a file `queries.txt` with one query per line:
```
John Smith CEO Microsoft
Jane Doe CTO Google
Bob Wilson CFO Apple
```

Run the search:
```bash
python perplexity_contact_finder.py -f queries.txt
```

### Resume a Previous Run
If the script was interrupted:
```bash
python perplexity_contact_finder.py -f queries.txt --resume
```

### Skip Verification / Perplexity Only Mode
To use only Perplexity without verification services:
```bash
# Option 1: Use --perplexity-only flag
python perplexity_contact_finder.py -f queries.txt --perplexity-only

# Option 2: Use --no-verify flag  
python perplexity_contact_finder.py -f queries.txt --no-verify
```

### Output Formats
Choose output format:
```bash
# CSV only
python perplexity_contact_finder.py -f queries.txt -o csv

# JSON only  
python perplexity_contact_finder.py -f queries.txt -o json

# Both (default)
python perplexity_contact_finder.py -f queries.txt -o both
```

## Output Files

The tool creates an `output` directory with:

1. **Standard CSV** (`contacts_TIMESTAMP.csv`):
   - All contact information with sources
   - Alternate emails and phones included
   - Verification status

2. **Apollo CSV** (`apollo_contacts_TIMESTAMP.csv`):
   - Format compatible with Apollo.io import
   - Separate rows for alternate emails

3. **JSON** (`contacts_TIMESTAMP.json`):
   - Complete data including raw responses
   - Full source citations
   - All metadata

## API Services

### Email Verification
- **Hunter.io**: Professional email verification with detailed checks
- **ZeroBounce**: AI-powered email scoring and validation

### Phone Verification
- **Numverify**: Global phone number validation
- **Twilio**: Carrier and caller ID lookup
- **Local**: Fallback using phonenumbers library

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Bulk Searches**: Design queries to find multiple contacts at once
   - Good: "California state senators contact list"
   - Better: "all California state senators email addresses and phone numbers"
   - Best: "current California state senators contact information including emails"

2. **Role-Based Searches**: Focus on positions rather than names
   - "Microsoft executive team contacts"
   - "Austin city council members emails"
   - "Fortune 500 healthcare CEOs contact list"

3. **Industry Searches**: Cast a wide net across industries
   - "renewable energy companies board members"
   - "Bay Area startup founders contact information"
   - "top pharmaceutical companies executives"

4. **Government Searches**: Be specific about jurisdiction
   - "Texas state government cabinet members"
   - "New York City department commissioners"
   - "EPA regional directors contact list"

5. **Rate Limits**: The tool respects API rate limits automatically

6. **Verification**: Email/phone verification improves data quality but takes longer

7. **Sources**: Always check the sources to verify information accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### No results found
- Try more specific queries
- Include company name and title
- Check if Perplexity can access the information

### Verification failing
- Check API keys are valid
- Ensure you have credits/quota remaining
- Some emails/phones may be unverifiable

### Script interrupted
- Use `--resume` to continue from where you left off
- Progress is automatically saved after each query

## Example Bulk Search Results

When searching for "California state senators contact list", the tool might return:

```
Found 40 contacts:

1. Name: Senator Jane Smith
   District: 1
   Email: senator.smith@senate.ca.gov
   Phone: +1-916-555-0001
   Sources: California Senate Website, Official Directory

2. Name: Senator Robert Johnson
   District: 2
   Email: senator.johnson@senate.ca.gov
   Phone: +1-916-555-0002
   Sources: Senate.ca.gov, District Office Page

... (and 38 more contacts)
```

The tool automatically:
- Finds all relevant contacts matching your search
- Extracts emails, phones, and other details
- Provides source citations for verification
- Exports to CSV/JSON for easy use

## Performance

- **Processing Time**: ~100-200 contacts in 30 minutes (with verification)
- **Without Verification**: 3-4x faster using `--no-verify` flag
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatically handled to respect API limits
- **Resume Capability**: Can handle interruptions and resume processing
